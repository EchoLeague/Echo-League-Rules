        1. Groups will play a Round-Robin until they have played each opponent at least once
        2. Top seeds in each group will advance
            1. Determined on a per-division basis
            2. Seeds & placement will be determined based off the 'Intra-Group' system listed in [TIEBREAKERS](https://github.com/EchoLeague/Echo-League-Rules/blob/master/TIEBREAKERS.md)
    2. Two week break after group stages
        1. This will be used for any tiebreaker playoffs, and for organizing for playoffs 
    3. Single Elimination playoffs
        1. Will consist of no more than 16 teams as determined on a per-division basis, based off of the division size
        2. After the second round of playoffs, there will be a one-week intermission before the third round during TI7 (Aug 6th-12th)
3. Each region will have 3 Divisions: An A-Tier, B-Tier, and C-Tier Division
    1. If some regions are underpopulated, we may reduce the number of tiers to help better fill divisions.  Group sizes or team placements may also be adjusted to better serve underpopulated divisions
4. Each division will be limited to the number of teams allowed
    1. There must be enough teams to fill enough groups to allow for playoffs
    2. Some groups may be padded with "BYE WEEK" teams if there are not enough registrations
    3. If we have too many registrations for one division, and cannot resolve it using a reasonable amount of "BYE WEEK" teams, we will remove teams by registration date
        1. Teams will be removed recentness of team registration date
5. The following match types and their series lengths are as follows:
    1. Group stage games will be a best of two.
    2. Playoff stage games will be a best of three.
    3. The grand final will be a best of five.
    4. Tiebreakers will be decided by admins based on time constraints
6. We will try to have a ticket approved for games to be played, but if there are delays (as there have been in the past), we will have lobbies off-ticket if admins are unavailable
    1. For games played off-ticket, the winning team must provide the following screenshots to have their game counted as official:
        1. Screenshot of the final “picks and bans” screen (from replay)
        2. Screenshot of end-game overview with matchID and timestamp
        3. Screenshot of the end-game scoreboard
    2. Failure to provide screenshots within a timely manner, to admins, will result in a series being ruled as a forfeit

## VII Scheduling

1. Every week in *Echo League Season 1* begins on Monday at 12:00 AM PDT and ends on Sunday at 11:59 PM PDT
2. All games for the upcoming week must be scheduled by the end of the previous week
    1. During groups, you must schedule with your "suggested opponent" by the end of your "suggested week".  You and that opponent are free to play outside that week (earlier or later), as long as it is before the end of group stages, if **both teams** agree, otherwise you should play on your suggested week to avoid conflict
    2. For playoffs, if there are extenuating circumstances preventing teams from playing during their assigned week, they can reach out to the Staff to try and arrange an off-schedule game.  These will only be allowed when there are no other options, when it will not impact future games, and when the staff has been given enough notice to arrange an alternative solution.
3. Games must be scheduled on the Echo League website to be officially counted as “scheduled by deadline”.
4. Failure of both teams to schedule by the deadline will result in a null-series (no points awarded to either team) in the official scoring.
    1. In the playoffs, this will result in the next team receiving a bye week
5. If you have attempted to schedule your game but the other team is not responding or there is a lack of response, then you must do the following and the administration team will make an assessment:
    1. Show messages of attempting to contact or scheduling the other team’s organizer.
    2. If the above is unable to be proved then you must show proof of attempting to add them on steam or attempt to contact them in other ways. (If necessary, attempt to contact a team member of that team).
6. If the game has been scheduled and the time is finalized. Both teams must agree to change it going forwards
    1. If both teams wish to reschedule, it must be done AT MINIMUM six hours in advance with both teams agreeing to the reschedule.
        1. Game must also be updated on the Echo League website using the “Delete and Reschedule” option by the individual who scheduled the first match
    2. If the game is rescheduled, Team Organizers must reach out to any casters that are scheduled to their game to inform them.
        1. Failure to do this may lead to being blacklisted by the casting team

## VIII Lobbies & In-Game Rules

1. All teams must use their official registered team name in the lobby, and only use players listed on their roster or approved stand-ins.

    1. If tickets, lobby-bots, or lobby creators are unavailable at time of game start, players can create an unticketed lobby and provide proof as listed in IV.3

        1. If GG is called accidentally (though ChatWheel, etc) and subsequently cancelled, the offending team must say in all-chat that they have cancelled the GG so there is no confusion. Every cancelled GG will be reviewed by the admin team to ensure that it did not impact the outcome of the game
        2. Every cancelled GG will also be considered an 'all-chat' violation and be subject to punishment in accordance with rule VIII.9

    2. Losing team will then choose the remaining option and their preference
    3. For game two, the order is flipped.  The team that lost the coinflip will now choose the server played on, and then pick order or side of their choosing.  Team that won the coinflip will choose the remaining option and their preference
