    3. Wishing the other team, “Good luck, have fun”, greeting or giving "shout outs", and/or any other polite announcements.
    4. Any polite post-game chatter ("Thanks for game", "good series", etc) before game is closed
    5. Incidental typing, such as putting a rosh timer in all-chat instead of team chat, or an errant letter or number when moving quickly (e.g. "qwrr   22").  This does not apply to anything greater than that.

10. Calling/saying “gg” (“Good Game”, “ggwp”, “gege”, or any other accepted variant) ends the game. Once “gg” is called, the game is instantly forfeited by the team who calls it
    1. If GG is called accidentally (though ChatWheel, etc) and subsequently cancelled, the offending team must say in all-chat that they have cancelled the GG so there is no confusion. Every cancelled GG will be reviewed by the admin team to ensure that it did not impact the outcome of the game
11. Pick order, Side, and Server will be determined in the following way:
    1. Teams will flip a coin for Game 1. Winning team will choose either the pick order or side.
      1. If there is a difference in preferred servers, winning team will also pick server for game 1
    2. Losing team will then choose the remaining option and their preference
    3. For game two, the order is flipped.  The team that lost the coinflip will now choose the server played on, and then pick order or side of their choosing.  Team that won the coinflip will choose the remaining option and their preference
    4. Repeat the coinflip for games 3 and 5 as needed
12. Valid Servers
    1. Only NA-West and NA-East may be selected as valid servers
