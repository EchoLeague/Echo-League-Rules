# Echo League Rules
The following repository is meant to hold all of the rules for the Echo League and it's events in an open, transparent location

The full rules will always be publicly available in this repo, and we will do our best to maintain parity on the website: http://echoleague.gg

Any changes to the rules can be examined in full by examining [the commit history](https://github.com/EchoLeague/Echo-League-Rules/commits/master).  A brief overview of major changes will be logged in CHANGELOG.md
