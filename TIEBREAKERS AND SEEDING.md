# Intra-Group Ties:

Scenario One: TWO teams tied for ONE playoff spot
=================================================

1.  Compare Head-to-Head record. If still tied proceed to 2.

2.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has won
    more games (including forfeits/byes as wins), that team advances.
    Else proceed to 3.

3.  Play a BO1. Winner advances.

Scenario Two: TWO teams tied for TWO playoff spots
==================================================

1.  Compare Head-to-Head record. If still tied proceed to 2.

2.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has won
    more games (including forfeits/byes as wins), that team advances.
    Else proceed to 3.

3.  Coin flip.

Scenario Three: THREE teams tied for ONE playoff spot
=====================================================

1.  Compare Head-to-Head record of the three teams. If one team has a
    worse Head-to-Head record than the other two teams, eliminate them.
    Proceed to Scenario One rules. Else proceed to 2.

2.  Compare Head-to-Head record of the three teams. If one team has a
    better record than the other two teams who are both tied with the
    same head-to-head record, then the team with the best record
    advances. Else proceed to 3.

3.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    higher record than both teams that team advances. Else proceed to 4.

4.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the other two teams that team is eliminated and
    the remaining two teams play a BO1. Else proceed to 5.

5.  Randomly assign each team a number according to random number
    assignment rules. The two teams with the lowest numbers play each
    other in a BO1 (referred to as GAME A), while the remaining team
    goes to the general tie-breaker pool for their division. If the team
    that went to the tie-breaker pool won their game or got a BYE win,
    they play the winner of game 1 in a BO1. If the team that went to
    the tie-breaker pool lost, then the winner of GAME A advances.

Scenario Four: THREE teams tied for TWO playoff spots
=====================================================

1.  Compare head-to-head record of the three teams. If one team has a
    worse head-to-head record than the other two teams, eliminate them
    and proceed to scenario two rules. Else proceed to 2.

2.  Compare head-to-head record of the three teams. If one team has a
    better head-to-head record than the other two teams that are tied
    with the same head-to-head record, then that team advances. Proceed
    to scenario 1 with the remaining teams. Else proceed to 3.

3.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    higher record than the other two teams they advance. Proceed to
    scenario 1 with the remaining teams. Else proceed to 4.

4.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the other two they are eliminated. The remaining
    two teams proceed to scenario 2. Else proceed to 5.

5.  Randomly assign each team a number. The two teams with the lowest
    number play a BO1 (referred to as GAME A), while the remaining team
    enters a general tie-breaker pool. If the team that went to the
    tie-breaker pool won their game or got a bye, then the loser of GAME
    A is eliminated and a coin flip determines playoff seeding. If the
    team that went to the tie-breaker pool lost, then the winner of GAME
    A advances with the higher seed. The loser of GAME A and the
    tie-breaker pool team play a BO1 with the loser eliminated and the
    winner taking the second seed.

Scenario Five: FOUR teams tied for ONE playoff spot
===================================================

1.  Compare head-to-head record of the four teams. If one team has a
    worse record than the other three teams, that team is eliminated and
    the remaining three teams proceed to scenario three. Else proceed
    to 2.

2.  Compare head-to-head record of the four teams. If two teams have a
    worse record than the other two teams and both teams are tied with
    the same record, both of the teams with the worse record are
    eliminated and the remaining two teams proceed to scenario one. Else
    proceed to 3.

3.  Compare head-to-head record of the four teams. If one team has a
    better record than all three remaining teams who are tied, then that
    team advances and the remaining three are eliminated. Else proceed
    to 4.

4.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the other three, that team is eliminated and the
    remaining teams proceed to scenario three. Else proceed to 5.

5.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the other two teams then both of those
    teams are eliminated and the remaining teams proceed to scenario 1.

6.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    better record than the remaining three teams who are tied, then that
    team advances and the three other teams are eliminated. Else proceed
    to step 7.

7.  Randomly assign each team a random number. The two teams with the
    lowest number play each other in a BO1 (GAME A), and the two teams
    with a higher number play each other (GAME B). The winner of GAME A
    plays the winner of GAME B in a BO1 (GAME C). The winner of GAME
    C advances.

Scenario Six: FOUR teams tied for TWO playoff spots.
====================================================

1.  Compare head to head record of the four teams. If one team has a
    worse record than the other three teams, that team is eliminated and
    the three remaining teams proceed to scenario four. Else proceed
    to 2.

2.  Compare head to head record of the four teams. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the other two teams, both of those teams
    are eliminated and the two remaining teams proceed to scenario 2.
    Else proceed to 3.

3.  Compare head to head record of the four teams. If one team has a
    better record than the three other teams that are tied, that team
    advances with the top seed and the remaining three teams proceed to
    scenario 3. Else proceed to 4.

4.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the other three, it is eliminated and the three
    remaining teams proceed to scenario four. Else proceed to 5.

5.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the other two, they are eliminated and the
    remaining two teams advance to scenario 2. Else proceed to 6.

6.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    better record than the remaining three teams that are tied, they
    advance with the top seed and the remaining three teams proceed to
    scenario 3. Else proceed to 7.

7.  Assign random numbers to each team. The two teams with the lowest
    random numbers play each other (GAME A), and with the highest random
    numbers play each other (GAME B). The losers of GAME A and GAME B
    are eliminated. The winners of GAME A and GAME B then proceed to
    scenario 2.

Scenario Seven: FIVE teams tied for ONE playoff spot.
=====================================================

1.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If one team has a
    worse record than the remaining four they are eliminated and the
    remaining four teams proceed to scenario 5. Else proceed to 2.

2.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the remaining three the two teams are
    eliminated and the remaining three proceed to scenario 3. Else
    proceed to 3.

3.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If three teams are
    tied with a worse record than the other two teams the three teams
    are eliminated and the remaining two proceed to scenario 1. Else
    priced to 4.

4.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If one team has a
    better record than the other four teams they advance to
    the playoffs. Else proceed to 5.

5.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the other four teams they are eliminated and the
    remaining four teams proceed to scenario 5. Else proceed to 6.

6.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the remaining three, they are eliminated
    and the remaining three teams proceed to scenario 3. Else proceed
    to 7.

7.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    better record than the remaining four they advance to the playoffs.
    Else proceed to 8.

8.  Assign each of the five teams a random number. The two teams with
    the lowest number play each other (GAME A), the two teams with the
    3rd and 4th lowest numbers play each other (GAME B), and the
    remaining team goes to the general tie-breaker pool. The losers of
    GAME A and GAME B are eliminated. If the team that went to the
    tie-breaker pool lost, then the winners of GAME A and GAME B play a
    BO1 with the winner advancing. If the team that went to the
    tie-breaker pool won, then the tie-breaker pool team plays the
    winner of GAME A (GAME C) and the winner of GAME B goes to the
    tie-breaker pool (POOL 2). If the winner of GAME B loses the POOL 2
    game, the winner of GAME C advances. If the winner of GAME B wins
    the POOL 2 game, then the winner of GAME B plays the winner of
    GAME C. The winner of this game advances.

Scenario Eight: FIVE teams tied for TWO playoff spots.
======================================================

1.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If one team has a
    worse record than the remaining four teams they are eliminated and
    the remaining four teams proceed to scenario 6. Else proceed to 2.

2.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the remaining three they are eliminated and
    the remaining three teams proceed to scenario 4. Else proceed to 3.

3.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If three teams are
    tied with a worse record than the remaining two teams they are
    eliminated and the remaining two teams proceed to scenario 2. Else
    proceed to 4.

4.  Compare head to head record of the five teams. If one team has a
    better record than the four other teams that team advanced with the
    top seed and the four remaining teams proceed to scenario 5. Else
    proceed to 5.

5.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    worse record than the four remaining teams that team is eliminated
    and the four remaining teams proceed to scenario 6. Else proceed
    to 6.

6.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If two teams are tied
    with a worse record than the four remaining teams those two teams
    are eliminated and the three remaining teams proceed to scenario 4.
    Else proceed to 7.

7.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If three teams are
    tied with a worse record than the two remaining teams those three
    teams are eliminated and the two remaining teams priced to
    scenario 2. Else proceed to 8.

8.  Compare overall number of games won and lost. If one team has a
    better record than the four remaining teams that team advances and
    the four remaining teams proceed to scenario 5. Else proceed to 9.

9.  Assign each of the five teams a random number. The two teams with
    the lowest number play each other (GAME A), the two teams with the
    3rd and 4th lowest number play each other (GAME B), and the fifth
    teams proceeds to the general tie-breaker pool (Pool 1). The losers
    of GAME A and GAME B are eliminated. If the team that went to Pool 1
    game lose, the winner of GAME A and GAME B advance with seeding
    determined by a coin flip. If the team that went to Pool 1 game won,
    then Pool 1 winner plays the winner of GAME A (GAME C) and GAME B
    winner goes to the tie-breaker pool (Pool 2). If the winner of GAME
    B wins the Pool 2 game then the winner of GAME C and GAME B advance
    with seeding determined by coin flip. If the winner of GAME B loses
    Pool 2 game, then the winner of GAME C advances with the highest
    seed. The loser of GAME C and Pool 2 play each other (GAME D). The
    winner of GAME D advances with the second seed and the loser
    is eliminated.

Scenario Nine: SIX teams tied for ONE playoff spot.
===================================================

1.  These rules assume that each group contains six teams. Assign each
    team a random number. The teams with the two lowest numbers play
    each other (GAME A), the teams with the 3rd and 4th lowest number
    play each other (GAME B), and the teams with the 5th and 6th lowest
    numbers play each other (GAME C). The winner of GAME A and GAME B
    play each other (Game D), while GAME C winner goes to the pool. If
    GAME C winner loses the pool game, then the winner of GAME
    D advances. If GAME C winner wins the pool game, then the winner of
    GAME C and GAME D play each other (GAME E). The winner of GAME E
    then advances.

Scenario 10: SIX teams tied for TWO playoff spots.
==================================================

1.  These rules assume that each group contains six teams. Assign each
    team a random number. The teams with the two lowest numbers play
    each other (GAME A), the teams with the 3rd and 4th lowest number
    play each other (GAME B) , and the teams with the 5th and 6th lowest
    numbers play each other (GAME C). The winner of GAME A and GAME B
    play each other (GAME D), while GAME C winner goes to the pool
    (Pool 1). If GAME C winner wins the pool game, then the winner of
    GAME C and the winner of GAME D proceed to scenario 2. If GAME C
    winner loses the pool game, then GAME D winner advances with the
    highest seeding. The loser of GAME D plays GAME C winner (GAME E),
    with the winner of GAME E advancing with the second seed.

Appendix A: The general tie-breaker pool
========================================

1.  Each division has a general tie-breaker pool of teams from their
    division. This pool is formed when teams are sent there to find a
    playoff opponent by one of the scenarios.

2.  Teams from Division A, B, and C cannot be matched against teams from
    another division letter (e.g. division B teams cannot play division
    C teams).

3.  Teams from the SEA division can only be matched with other teams
    from the SEA division and cannot play a team from the US or
    EU division.

4.  Teams from the US division will be assigned a random number. The
    team with the lowest random number in the US division will play the
    team with the second lowest random number in the US division, the
    team with the third lowest random number in the US division will
    play the team with the fourth lowest random number in the US
    division, and so on as long as there is another opponent in the US
    division available. This process is repeated for the EU division and
    the SEA division. If there are an odd number of teams in the US or
    EU divisions then teams should refer to section 5. Section 6 and
    Section 7 can override this rule.

5.  If it is the case that there are an odd number of teams in both the
    US and EU divisions in the pool, then the highest number team in US
    and EU will play a BO1 against each other with the server set to
    U.S. East. If there are an odd number of teams in the U.S. but an
    even number of teams in the EU division then the U.S. team with the
    highest number will get a bye. If there are an odd number of EU
    teams but an even number of U.S. teams then the EU team with the
    highest number will get a bye.

6.  In case Scenario 8 section 9 occurs in exactly one group then the
    winner of GAME B will be assigned random number 0. If there are only
    two teams that enter the pool (the fifth team from scenario 8 and
    the winner of GAME B) then both pool games will end in a bye.
    Otherwise, if it occurs that the fifth team to enter the pool gets
    the second lowest random number (second to the GAME B winner set at
    0), they will be assigned a new random number. If they still have
    the second lowest random number, this process is repeated until it
    is no longer the case.

7.  In case scenario 8 section 9 occurs for two or more groups, then the
    winner of GAME B from each group will be assigned a random number
    that will then be multiplied by $10^{-1000}$.

Appendix B: Random Number Generation
====================================

1.  Once it is determined by one of the scenario rules that a team is to
    be assigned a random number, the admin team will use the following
    code in R to assign a random number: runif(1,0,1)

2.  The output of the code is taken as the random number assigned to the
    team unless it needs to be corrected due to Appendix A Section 7. If
    two teams are assigned the same random number, then the R code will
    be rerun for each team.

3.  The most recent non-beta stable release of R is to be used. If the
    most recent non-beta release of R has an issue that prevents the
    runif code from being run the admin team reserves the right to use
    an earlier version of R where the issue is not present.

Appendix C: Tie-Breaker Games
=============================

1.  All tie-breaker games are BO1. Coin flip is used to determine who
    chooses first pick or side.

2.  In the scenario that a team plays multiple tie-breaker games and is
    playing another team that has played multiple tie-breaker games,
    then the team who has won the least number of coin flips is
    considered to automatically win the coin flip. If both teams are
    tied in the number of coin flips they have won, then another coin
    flip shall occur to determine the coin flip winner. Automatic coin
    flip wins are considered coin flip wins, but coin flips that do not
    occur due to a team being late to join a lobby are not counted.

3.  As previously stated if an EU team plays a US team the server will
    be U.S. East. Otherwise, the default server for the division will
    be used.

4.  If there is an outage on a server, the admin team reserves the right
    to force the game to be played on another server or delay the game
    based on what servers are available and stable.

Appendix D: Additional Clarifications
=====================================

1.  “Better” or “Worse” record in head to head is the total number of
    games won when considering games consisting of all teams in
    the tie-break. Total number of matches won is the total number of
    wins including wins from Byes and disbanded teams. This will always
    be the same among all teams if one point is always awarded for each
    win, assuming all games are played. This can potentially be
    different if 3 points are assigned for a 2-0.

2.  Coin flips will be handled using the following algorithm in R in
    accordance with section 3 of Appendix
    B: sample(c(Heads,Tails),1,replace=T)


# Inter-Group Ties:

## Use Cases

To be used to rank teams between groups for playoff seeding, and assign round-of-16 byes as necessary

## Criteria One:

Placement in group, after applying all intra-group tiebreakers.

## Criteria Two:

At end of group stages, assign a point value to each team guaranteed to advance onto the playoffs from their group. Do so in descending order, so the top seeded team is worth the most points (e.g. 3 teams advancing, 1 seed is worth 3 points, 2 seed is worth 2 points, 3 seed is worth 1 point).

For playoff teams finishing at the same position in their respective groups, take their record against the other advancing teams within their group, and assign points equal to each advancing team's weight for each win the team has against an advancing team.  (e.g., team is 0-2 against the 1 seed, gaining 0 points.  2-0 vs the 2 seed, gaining 4 points, and 1-1 against the 3rd seed, gaining 1 point.   Total of 5 points).

After this has been done for all teams finishing at the same position in their respective groups, compare their value and seed teams accordingly from highest score to lowest.

If there are ties proceed to criteria three.

## Criteria Three:

At end of group stages, assign a point value to each team guaranteed to advance onto the playoffs from their group. Each team's points should be equal to their EL Rank at the end of the season.

For playoff teams finishing at the same position in their respective groups, take their record agains the other advancing teams within their group, and assign points equal to each advancing team's EL Rank for each win the team has against an advancing team.

After this has been done for all teams finishing at the same position in their respective groups, compare their value and seed teams accordingly from highest score to lowest.

If there are still ties proceed to criteria four.

## Criteria Four

If teams are still tied after the first three methods, assign each tied team a number value, and roll a fair dice to determine seeding between the tied teams, highest score to lowest.
